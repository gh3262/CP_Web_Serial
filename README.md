A simple HTML page to work with CircuitPython REPL. Written with the help of AI chat in VS Code. Agent was GPT 4.1.

The web pate generated has a Connect button at the top left which will bring up a list of devices connected to COM ports. There is a baud rate selector and the default is 115200. 

There are two blue buttons which will send Ctrl-C (Quit running code) and Ctrl-D (restart the code). 

Next there are two yellow buttons for copying from or pasting to the REPL.

The last button clears the display. The REPL output will scroll.

At the bottom is a text box to allow the entry of commands to the REPL. Type in the box and then hit Send. Output code is in blue, entered text is green.
